This post is a smattering of thoughts that have been bubbling around in my head.

I've been avoiding it for a while now, but its becoming increasingly clear to me that I'll need to get some cloud certifications in the near future.
<br />
I've been doing a LOT with AWS lately, and I know enough to be dangerous but there are some obvious gaps in my understanding. Most annoyingly, the UI changes in AWS's console over the years have contributed.

Since becoming tech lead of our team I have struggled to introspect successfully about my career. There's always so much to be done - an Angular upgrade [here](https://twitter.com/SabbaghBlog/status/1773456055084683538), a sales team meeting there, even some Java as of late.
<br />
The problem is not the work - I _love_ being able to work across all ends of the stack. I think I need to spend dedicated weekly time to journal about work. I do this in other areas of my life, so I should do the same with my work life.

I've been able to do a poor man's job of filling in for the CTO while he's been out, with much-needed help from team members. That has been a blast.
<br />
Which full-circles back to the first thought smattering. To be more effective I should probably get those certs..
