	- [ ] did 4, 4 more to go until we're almost clean!
- [ ] Add Frontend tasks for pointing next week
	- [ ] New task - expand all violations <-> collapse all violations. could probably register an event emitter when each one is rendered, and initiate them all via button click?
	- [ ] New task - deep linking into violations! That's pretty much just an anchor to it, right? And how to load the URL? depends on how we store them?
	- [ ] new task - we're loading 300 events on `tap/api/v1/alerts/events` ; can we add a querystring for:
		- [ ] how many to load?
		- [ ] id parameter for fetching a single violation? related to deep linking above
		- [ ] UI for when the querystring in that API call is for a single id; can we bring up a modal that has the information, with a link to the main dashboard or similar?
		- [ ] rewrite user create components (might identify other issues too)
- [x] update azure cert
- [ ] Task templates for combine-aws and combine-azure repos
- [x] Torch endpoints in Combine Azure for gigamon lol
- [ ] Azure tasking - dev parity with endpoints, k8s watch, tunneling

* well, these are already written. So should I pivot to actually doing some of them? Maybe endpoints container for azure?

	- [ ] New task - deep linking into violations! That's pretty much just an anchor to it, right? And how to load the URL? depends on how we store them?

Next Week

* List for Stephen
	
	- [ ] Task templates now ready when creating new tasks!
	- [ ] [Salesforce JDev Negative Serial Number (NSN) Rotation Notes](Salesforce JDev Negative Serial Number (NSN) Rotation Notes.md)
	- [ ] PRs that we want to merge into dev before dev goes into master
		- [ ] migration of partition ids - <https://github.com/Combine-Pathfinder-Palisade/combine-aws/issues/1457>
		- [ ] additional stack tags (into master) - <https://github.com/Combine-Pathfinder-Palisade/combine-aws/pull/1770>, already used for Gigamon
		- [ ] workload health tool (into master), Elton wants it and it's part of his negative cert pipeline - <https://github.com/Combine-Pathfinder-Palisade/combine-aws/pull/1758>
		- [ ] Merge Kubernetified Combine (into dev) - <https://github.com/Combine-Pathfinder-Palisade/combine-aws/pull/1760>
			- [ ] we would want to do this before merging dev into master for 3.14, so that we can give to SF
		- [ ] Angular on TAP to latest version 21, into dev - <https://github.com/Combine-Pathfinder-Palisade/combine-aws/pull/1776>
	
	- [ ] then I think we'll be ready for dev -> master!
	
	- [ ] dev containers - we need to be in sync about the versions in dev and master: `bricks_v_3_14_rc` since we all depend on it for local dev!
	- [ ] Idea - after 3.14 is cut and TAP is 100% parity in dev and master, can we commit strictly frontend-related changes to both branches?
	- [ ] Mason used Codex to add a bunch of rewriters!!!
	- [ ] tests for PATTERN\_ARN for encoded/unencoded ARNs - <https://github.com/Combine-Pathfinder-Palisade/combine-aws/issues/1603>
	- [ ] My purpose statement for Work this year
	- [ ] Francisco having trouble with veritas - structure approach for onboarding more team members to infrastructure work?
	- [ ] Discuss having two others review PRs?
	- [ ] go over frontend tasks I've put up? maybe during sync?
